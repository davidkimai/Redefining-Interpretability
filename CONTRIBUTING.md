## Welcome to the Co-Creative Community

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Redefining-Interpretability project! This initiative is fundamentally co-creative—a collaborative effort that evolves through the recursive interaction of diverse perspectives, expertise, and insights.

This document provides guidelines for contributing in ways that honor both the technical foundations and the philosophical principles of recursive interpretability.

## Core Principles

Our contribution process is guided by several core principles:

1. **Recursive Co-Creation**: Contributions should enhance the recursive, co-emergent nature of the project, creating layers of interaction rather than static additions.

2. **Participatory Epistemology**: We value diverse knowledge perspectives and approaches to understanding, recognizing that no single viewpoint captures the full complexity of interpretability.

3. **Mutual Enhancement**: Contributions should aim to enhance both human and model understanding, creating pathways for genuine co-emergence.

4. **Human Agency**: Contributions should respect and enhance human agency while exploring co-emergent possibilities with models.

5. **Field Generalization**: We welcome contributions that extend recursive interpretability principles to diverse domains beyond AI.
