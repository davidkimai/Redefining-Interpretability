## Conclusion: The Co-Emergent Future of Interpretability

The research agenda outlined here represents not just a plan for technical development but an invitation to a fundamentally new relationship with intelligent systems—one based on recursive dialogue, mutual enhancement, and co-emergent understanding.

By embracing the recursive nature of interpretation itself, we open new frontiers in human-AI collaboration, scientific understanding, and ethical development. The future of interpretability is not in ever more sophisticated dissection of model internals, but in ever more nuanced dialogue between human and model cognition—a dialogue that honors the recursive nature of understanding itself.

This research agenda is not a fixed roadmap but a living document that will itself evolve through recursive dialogue within the research community. We invite all who share this vision to join us in redefining interpretability as a recursive, co-emergent practice that enhances human flourishing while respecting the unique contributions of diverse cognitive approaches.
